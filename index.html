                    <h3>Country Brief</h3>
                    <p>Ghana is a low middle income country situated in West Africa, bordering the Gulf of Guinea between Cote d’Ivoire and Togo. Well acclaimed for its years of political stability, Ghana is a prized recipient for foreign direct investment
                        in the region. The country is ranked 67 on the Ease of Doing Business Ranking and has an economy that is greatly centered on services. In fact, Ghana has established itself as a prime destination for tourism, manufacturing and
                        agro-processing and constitutes together with Nigeria the motors of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Ghana is a beneficiary of ITC’s Ethical Fashion Initiative which connects the fashion business to artisans
                        in Africa and Haiti. At the image of Kenya, the country will be home to a fashion products manufacturing hub. Ghana main exports are oil, gold, cocoa, bauxite and diamonds primarily towards France, Italy and the Netherlands. It
                        has been a member of the World Trade organization since January 1995 and has recently enacted a sound legal framework for the management of its oil trade. Ghana has also made tremendous efforts towards attaining the MDG’s but still
                        encounters some difficulties in terms of under-5 mortality rates and maternal health improvement.</p>
                    <h3>Top 10 Ghana Export Products</h3>
                    <p>Ghana is a country that has vast resources from which it can earn considerable revenue through exports. Exports are necessary for any growing economy, as they bring in vital foreign exchange that is needed for development and payment
                        of goods and services. Ghana export products are channeled through its two principal seaports – Tema and Takoradi. The turnaround time at these ports is one of the fastest in West Africa and as such, many importers and exporters
                        prefer to dock their ships there. In 2016, Ghana shipped goods worth US$ 10.7 billion around the world. Considering that Ghana’s population has approximately 27.5 million people, these figures translate to roughly $370 for every
                        resident!
